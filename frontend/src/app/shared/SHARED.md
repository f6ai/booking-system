### Shared feature module
SharedModule contains code that will be used across your feature modules. You only import the SharedModule into the specific feature modules. Ensure you donâ€™t import the SharedModule into your AppModule or CoreModule.

Application-wide singleton services do not belong to the SharedModule, they should be in the CoreModule. SharedModule is only for keeping common components, pipes & directives. Layout component is a great example of a shared component.

**Do** create a feature module named `SharedModule` in a `shared` folder;
for example, `app/shared/shared.module.ts` defines `SharedModule`.

**Do** declare components, directives, and pipes in a shared module when those
items will be re-used and referenced by the components declared in other feature modules.

**Consider** using the name SharedModule when the contents of a shared
module are referenced across the entire application.

**Consider** _not_ providing services in shared modules. Services are usually
singletons that are provided once for the entire application or
in a particular feature module. There are exceptions, however. For example, in the sample code that follows, notice that the `SharedModule` provides `FilterTextService`. This is acceptable here because the service is stateless;that is, the consumers of the service aren't impacted by new instances.

**Do** import all modules required by the assets in the `SharedModule`;
for example, `CommonModule` and `FormsModule`.

**Why?** `SharedModule` will contain components, directives and pipes
that may need features from another common module; for example,
`ngFor` in `CommonModule`.

**Do** declare all components, directives, and pipes in the `SharedModule`.

**Do** export all symbols from the `SharedModule` that other feature modules need to use.

**Why?** `SharedModule` exists to make commonly used components, directives and pipes available for use in the templates of components in many other modules.

**Avoid** specifying app-wide singleton providers in a `SharedModule`. Intentional singletons are OK. Take care.

**Why?** A lazy loaded feature module that imports that shared module will make its own copy of the service and likely have undesirable results.

**Why?** You don't want each module to have its own separate instance of singleton services.
Yet there is a real danger of that happening if the `SharedModule` provides a service.
